Core Yarn Commands
===========================
yarn add next
yarn add -D @types/next
yarn up
yarn up next
yarn remove @types/node

===========================
Running Scripts
===========================
yarn run build
This command triggers the build process for your project. In a Next.js app, it runs next build, which compiles and optimizes your application for production. It generates an optimized set of static files and server-side code in the .next directory. This step is typically done before deploying your app to a production environment. It ensures your app is minified, bundled, and ready for peak performance. You’d use this when you’re preparing to ship your app.

yarn next dev
This runs next dev, which starts your Next.js app in development mode. It launches a local development server (usually on localhost:3000) with features like hot reloading, so changes you make to your code are reflected instantly without needing to restart the server. It’s unoptimized and includes debugging tools, making it ideal for writing and testing code during development. Use this when you’re actively building or tweaking your app.

yarn start
This runs next start, which starts your Next.js app in production mode using the output from yarn run build. It assumes the .next directory already exists (from a prior build) and serves your app as a performant, production-ready server. No hot reloading or dev tools here—it’s all about efficiency and stability. You’d use this after building your app, typically on a server or locally to test the production version.
